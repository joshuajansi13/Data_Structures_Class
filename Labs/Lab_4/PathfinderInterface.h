	* Returns a string representation of the current maze. Returns a maze of all 1s if no maze

	* A valid string representation of a maze consists only of 125 1s and 0s (each separated
	* by spaces) arranged in five 5x5 grids (each separated by newlines) with no trailing newline. A valid maze must
	* also have 1s in the entrance cell (0, 0, 0) and in the exit cell (4, 4, 4).
	*
	* Cell (0, 0, 0) is represented by the first number in the string representation of the
	* maze. Increasing in x means moving toward the east, meaning cell (1, 0, 0) is the second
	* number. Increasing in y means moving toward the south, meaning cell (0, 1, 0) is the
	* sixth number. Increasing in z means moving downward to a new grid, meaning cell
	* (0, 0, 1) is the twenty-sixth cell in the maze. Cell (4, 4, 4) is represented by the last number.

	* (or an empty vector if no solution is found). This list cannot contain duplicates, and
	* any two consecutive coordinates in the list can only differ by 1 for only one
	* coordinate. The entrance cell (0, 0, 0) and the exit cell (4, 4, 4) should be included
